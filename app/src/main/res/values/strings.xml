    <string name="paragraph1">Alex Kagan, a Swartzberg House resident and client of CJE’s Holocaust Community Services, is
determined to remain active and engaged in life. In his 80s, Kagan has an impressively large
collection of computer-generated images that he has created, even though he only started producing
them in 2016. His subject matter includes landscapes, gatherings, symbols, flowers and other subject
 matter.</string>

    <string name="paragraph2">Kagan, who emigrated from the former Belarus to live in the US, was born in Minsk. He lost all of
 his family during the Holocaust. He has a PhD in computer science and spent his career as a
 computer specialist in artificial intelligence. Kagan prefers not to talk about the process of
 creating his artwork. Suffice it to say that he controls his computer’s “brain” to convert
 photographic images into expressive, painterly artworks. He then prints them off on glossy photo
 paper, and the results are stunning.</string>
