Alex Kagan, a Swartzberg House resident and client of CJE’s Holocaust Community Services, is
determined to remain active and engaged in life. In his 80s, Kagan has an impressively large
collection of computer-generated images that he has created, even though he only started producing
them in 2016. His subject matter includes landscapes, gatherings, symbols, flowers and other subject
 matter.

Kagan, who emigrated from the former Belarus to live in the US, was born in Minsk. He lost all of
 his family during the Holocaust. He has a PhD in computer science and spent his career as a
 computer specialist in artificial intelligence. Kagan prefers not to talk about the process of
 creating his artwork. Suffice it to say that he controls his computer’s “brain” to convert
 photographic images into expressive, painterly artworks. He then prints them off on glossy photo
 paper, and the results are stunning.

 Kagan describes himself as, “Not an artist in the traditional sense. But I was always interested in
  it from my younger years. So these two things came together, inside my heart.” Kagan is delighted
  to share his art with CJE, and he is very eager for it to be shown. To that end, one of Kagan’s
  pieces will be used for CJE’s annual Rosh Hashanah card. Plus, a series of exhibits of his works
  will be held at the Bernard Horwich Building starting in mid-October.
